# Stochastic_simulation_HW3

To run the code, aThe a280.tsp.txt, a280.opt.tour.txt, eil51.tsp.txt and eil51.opt.tour.txt should be in the same Directory as the .ipynb files.
tsp_51.ipynb contains the data processing and algorithm for the 51 cities tsp.
tsp_280.ipynb contains the data processing and algorithm for the 280 cities tsp.

To run the code open the files in jupyter notebook and select Run All from the Cell tab. 

If you want to save the figures generated by the algorithm, a map named 'figs' should be present in the same Directory.
If you don't want to save figures, make sure no map named 'figs' is present
